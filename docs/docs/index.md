## Installing and running Mesos-DNS

Stable binaries for the project are published via the GitHub release
channel: https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-dns/releases.

To run Mesos-DNS, you first need to install the `mesos-dns` binary somewhere on a selected server. The server can be the same machine as one of the Mesos masters, one of the slaves, or a dedicated machine on the same network. Next, follow [these instructions](configuration-parameters.html) to create a configuration file for your cluster. You can launch Mesos-DNS with: 

```
sudo mesos-dns -config=config.json & 
```

For fault tolerance, we ***recommend*** that you use [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon) to launch Mesos-DNS on one of the Mesos slaves. If Mesos-DNS fails, Marathon will re-launch it immediately, ensuring nearly uninterrupted service. You can select which slave is used for Mesos-DNS with [Marathon constraints](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/docs/docs/constraints.md) on the slave hostname or any slave attribute. For example, the following json description instructs Marathon to launch Mesos-DNS on the slave with hostname `10.181.64.13`:

```
{
"cmd": "sudo  /usr/local/mesos-dns/mesos-dns -config=/usr/local/mesos-dns/config.json",
"cpus": 1.0, 
"mem": 1024,
"id": "mesos-dns",
"instances": 1,
"constraints": [["hostname", "CLUSTER", "10.181.64.13"]]
}
```
Note that the `hostname` field refers to the hostname used by the slave when it registers with Mesos. It may not be an IP address or a valid hostname of any kind. You can inspect the hostnames and attributes of slaves on a Mesos cluster through the master web interface. For instance, you can access the `state` REST endpoint with:

```
curl http://master_hostname:5050/master/state.json | python -mjson.tool
```

### Slave Setup

To allow Mesos tasks to use Mesos-DNS as the primary DNS server, you must edit the file `/etc/resolv.conf` in every slave and add a new nameserver. For instance, if `mesos-dns` runs on the server with IP address `10.181.64.13`, you should add the line `nameserver 10.181.64.13` at the ***beginning*** of `/etc/resolv.conf` on every slave node. This can be achieve by running:

```
sudo sed -i '1s/^/nameserver 10.181.64.13\n /' /etc/resolv.conf
```

If multiple instances of Mesos-DNS are launched, add a nameserver line for each one at the beginning of `/etc/resolv.conf`. The order of these entries determines the order that the slave will use to contact Mesos-DNS instances. You can set `options rotate` to instruct select between the listed nameservers in a round-robin manner for load balancing.  

All other nameserver settings in `/etc/resolv.conf` should remain unchanged. The `/etc/resolv.conf` file in the masters should only change if the master machines are also used as slaves. 

You can also use Mesos-DNS to serve just a *forward lookup zone* from your primary DNS server (see [this tutorial](tutorial-forward.html)). In this case, you do not need to make any changes to the slaves in the cluster.
